    """AppiumLibrary is a Mobile App testing library for Robot Framework.

    = Locating or specifying elements =

    All keywords in AppiumLibrary that need to find an element on the page
    take an argument, either a ``locator`` or a ``webelement``. ``locator``
    is a string that describes how to locate an element using a syntax
    specifying different location strategies. ``webelement`` is a variable that
    holds a WebElement instance, which is a representation of the element.

    == Using locators ==

    By default, when a locator is provided, it is matched against the key attributes
    of the particular element type. For iOS and Android, key attribute is ``id`` for
    all elements and locating elements is easy using just the ``id``. For example:

    | Click Element    id=my_element

    New in AppiumLibrary 1.4, ``id`` and ``xpath`` are not required to be specified,
    however ``xpath`` should start with ``//`` else just use ``xpath`` locator as explained below.

    For example:

    | Click Element    my_element
    | Wait Until Page Contains Element    //*[@type="android.widget.EditText"]


    Appium additionally supports some of the [https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html|Mobile JSON Wire Protocol] locator strategies.
    It is also possible to specify the approach AppiumLibrary should take
    to find an element by specifying a lookup strategy with a locator
    prefix. Supported strategies are:

    | *Strategy*        | *Example*                                                      | *Description*                     | *Note*                      |

    | xpath             | Click Element `|` xpath=//UIATableView/UIATableCell/UIAButton  | Matches with arbitrary XPath      |                             |

    == Using webelements ==

    Starting with version 1.4 of the AppiumLibrary, one can pass an argument
    that contains a WebElement instead of a string locator. To get a WebElement,
    use the new `Get WebElements` or `Get WebElement` keyword.

    For example:
    | @{elements}    Get Webelements    class=UIAButton
    | Click Element    @{elements}[2]
